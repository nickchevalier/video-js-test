00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.449
[MUSIC]

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:10.060
This week,

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.875
we're going to focus on gathering information and visuals that help support ideas,

00:00:14.875 --> 00:00:20.230
concepts, and statistics that are more effective than words and numbers alone.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.320
Our objectives will be to learn how to support

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.055
messages with research and quality information,

00:00:27.055 --> 00:00:30.745
evaluate the process for disseminating this information,

00:00:30.745 --> 00:00:33.160
and we'll learn how visuals can be part of

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.660
the support needed to further clarify messages.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.445
Let's go back in time and reflect on the notion that much of writing is thinking,

00:00:43.445 --> 00:00:48.275
but thoughts and ideas stand alone without some support.

00:00:48.275 --> 00:00:53.360
Credible information comes in many forms and as good business communicators,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.365
we need to know where to obtain these treasures of information.

00:00:57.365 --> 00:01:03.860
Among the characteristics of good writing and specifically report writing is making sure

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.100
your information is factually correct and includes

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.510
all the necessary support for all your key assertions.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.690
In most cases, information should be

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.070
balanced if it is to present all sides of an argument.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.740
It should be clear and logical,

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.950
as well as properly documented if credit is given to

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.595
all primary and secondary sources of information used.

00:01:29.595 --> 00:01:35.590
Primary sources are essentially those which are conducted by yourself,

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.415
like initiating a survey or compiling data.

00:01:39.415 --> 00:01:44.165
It can also be primary research conducted by others.

00:01:44.165 --> 00:01:50.400
Secondary research is that which is written about by others.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.620
Let's think of it this way.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.145
If you write about an original research study,

00:01:56.145 --> 00:01:59.495
you're the source of secondary research here.

00:01:59.495 --> 00:02:03.210
It's your interpretation of an original study,

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.720
a primary source of research that makes for a secondary source.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.185
When you read a newspaper,

00:02:11.185 --> 00:02:17.035
please take note of how reporters often cite evidence in the form of original research.

00:02:17.035 --> 00:02:21.930
This gives the author credibility and often helps support an assertion.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.075
Now that we understand what types of research are out there,

00:02:26.075 --> 00:02:30.920
let's contemplate the process of gathering this vital information.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.620
I'd like you to pause for a moment though,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.830
and realize as you look at this chart that it's going to take some time.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.785
Research and gathering information is time consuming.

00:02:43.785 --> 00:02:46.790
It's not something you want to rush into either,

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.950
because the amount of time spent in

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.235
this discovery stage of writing results in a superior product.

00:02:54.235 --> 00:02:59.850
It's like having all the quality ingredients ready when you bake or cook something,

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.700
when you've taken the time to research and gather

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.585
the right ingredients and have them assembled in order of use,

00:03:06.585 --> 00:03:11.160
the baking and cooking process moves like a dream,

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.640
and the product is particularly high quality as a result.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.865
Plus, it's more fun. The first stage is planning your research.

00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:23.390
It's a good idea to make this part of your outline,

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.905
and you can even turn your writing outline into a research outline.

00:03:27.905 --> 00:03:31.850
One way to do this is to make notes to yourself in

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.065
specific areas of the outline where support is needed and so on.

00:03:37.065 --> 00:03:40.885
The next stage is finding the information,

00:03:40.885 --> 00:03:45.250
contemplate if you're going to have to peruse files,

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.045
interview people, obtain copies of data and so on.

00:03:49.045 --> 00:03:54.775
This is a good time to list the areas of information gathering you'll need to address.

00:03:54.775 --> 00:03:56.830
Timing is critical here,

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.455
because once you've assembled your list,

00:03:59.455 --> 00:04:03.225
some sources of information may take longer to obtain,

00:04:03.225 --> 00:04:06.685
so you'll want to move those to the top of the to do list.

00:04:06.685 --> 00:04:11.575
Please keep track of your research and a log outline or on your computer.

00:04:11.575 --> 00:04:16.675
Again, make notes to yourself because once you walk away from this experience,

00:04:16.675 --> 00:04:19.270
it's too easy to forget where you've been and

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.645
where you'll need to go once you return to the process.

00:04:22.645 --> 00:04:26.245
After you've planned your research and where to obtain it,

00:04:26.245 --> 00:04:30.640
identify and decide how it's going to present itself in your work.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.935
There are three options,

00:04:32.935 --> 00:04:37.110
paraphrase, summarize, or quote.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.865
If you paraphrase short bits of information,

00:04:40.865 --> 00:04:43.085
put it in your own words,

00:04:43.085 --> 00:04:45.740
a summary is in your own words as well,

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.480
but mostly addresses the volume of information or an entire document.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.760
Quoting is when you take items word for word from

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.775
a document or it's quoted directly from a person stating something.

00:04:59.775 --> 00:05:04.625
Quotation marks indicate where the statement starts and finishes.

00:05:04.625 --> 00:05:08.540
For good writing, be sure your quote enhances what you've

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.805
presented and doesn't merely repeat what's been stated.

00:05:12.805 --> 00:05:14.820
Quotes should have energy,

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.350
and they should have meaning,

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.640
numbers and statistics should also have relevance.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.880
Once you've gathered your information and made notes,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.690
it's time to draw conclusions based on the research you've done.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.510
Think in terms of a research paper here,

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.040
as business communication is just as heavily research based.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.170
Business reports and letters,

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.790
memos and emails may not have the formality and length of a research paper,

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.380
but they are just as needy when it comes to quality information gathering.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.665
Lastly, manage your information.

00:05:49.665 --> 00:05:51.150
Collect your research,

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.345
and share it through a medium appropriate for the message.

00:05:54.345 --> 00:05:58.755
If your research has discovered a potential solution to a problem,

00:05:58.755 --> 00:06:04.155
consider the stakeholders and how you might disseminate your valuable conclusions.

00:06:04.155 --> 00:06:06.985
Before we leave our chat about research,

00:06:06.985 --> 00:06:11.190
please take time to review your textbook about important resources for

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:17.190
business research and get familiar with the online and print resources available to you.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.830
Everyone loves pictures.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.110
Visuals create interest,

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.600
illustrate and clarify important points,

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.350
and add variety to any kind of presentation,

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.770
whether it's a PowerPoint or a formal written report.

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:37.035
Visuals help listeners and readers absorb information more quickly.

00:06:37.035 --> 00:06:42.480
As you contemplate the design of a visual element consider color,

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.440
artwork, photographs, type faces,

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.445
and type styles and also consider consistency.

00:06:50.445 --> 00:06:56.325
Color is a critical design element because it can emphasize ideas,

00:06:56.325 --> 00:06:59.760
create contrast, and emphasize certain elements.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.580
As you can see by this chart,

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.560
color can actually provide a powerful nonverbal component to your message.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.585
According to Bowie and Phil,

00:07:09.585 --> 00:07:12.570
a palette of cool grays and blue says

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.559
something different than a palette of warm oranges and browns,

00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:21.360
which say something different than a palette of hot pink and lime green.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.710
If you want to excite your audience and stimulate certain emotions,

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:31.035
this table suggests warm colors such as red and orange in your visual.

00:07:31.035 --> 00:07:33.945
If a more relaxed tone is intended,

00:07:33.945 --> 00:07:36.540
then blue is a better choice.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.120
In Western culture, this works.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.985
But if we reflect to week one,

00:07:41.985 --> 00:07:44.220
cultural considerations with regard to

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:48.710
color use might be appropriate depending on your audience.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:52.510
Artwork is another consideration for visuals,

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:59.395
we can consider artwork to be a functional or decorative feature of writing visuals.

00:07:59.395 --> 00:08:03.910
Functional artwork can be photographs, technical drawings,

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:08.680
charts, and other visual elements with information that's part of your message.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.070
Even infographics can be dynamic and value

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:16.215
added choices for presenting valuable information.

00:08:16.215 --> 00:08:22.890
Decorative artwork and photographs create emotional tone or amplify a message,

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:26.165
particularly with free-form presentation slides.

00:08:26.165 --> 00:08:28.850
This is helpful when the writer wants

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:34.650
a high impact message that will be easier to remember than text.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:40.730
There is a lot of clip art and easily available artwork for use in slides.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:46.955
But please be sure it's relevant and merely not just decorative without a purpose.

00:08:46.955 --> 00:08:52.220
Artistic elements should convey a message and avoid a cartoony appearance,

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.725
as it's not usually considered professional.

00:08:54.725 --> 00:09:00.770
Again, audience analysis becomes an important part of including artistic elements.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:04.805
Color and artwork are visual elements, for sure.

00:09:04.805 --> 00:09:08.915
But font size and style is also critical.

00:09:08.915 --> 00:09:14.045
You'll want to consider the brand you're maintaining when deciding on a font style.

00:09:14.045 --> 00:09:17.810
Branding is an important facet to business communications,

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:22.280
and savvy businesses ensure their brand is reflected throughout

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:27.715
the organization even in font style used in correspondence.

00:09:27.715 --> 00:09:32.265
Readers assign meaning to visual elements immediately,

00:09:32.265 --> 00:09:35.915
whether it's a PowerPoint slide or a report cover.

00:09:35.915 --> 00:09:40.100
Be consistent and don't use too many different fonts.

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.715
In fact, if you want to achieve variety,

00:09:43.715 --> 00:09:46.130
use the same font,

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:51.500
but change the size or boldface or underline items because

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:57.935
this can also provide effective variety without confusing the reader.

00:09:57.935 --> 00:10:02.275
Clearly, size is an important consideration for font.

00:10:02.275 --> 00:10:07.685
You'll want it to be readable from afar if it's a screen presentation,

00:10:07.685 --> 00:10:13.640
and large enough in print so that one can read it comfortably.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.460
For most business correspondents,

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.450
12 point font is standard.

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:23.250
We've discussed research and visual elements this week.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:28.320
In discussion you'll conduct a hunt for original research in a news article,

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.605
and we'll also share our favorite online sources for research,

00:10:31.605 --> 00:10:35.295
which proves to be a great way to share exceptional sites.

00:10:35.295 --> 00:10:39.600
Let's engage in discussion early often and weave

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.625
those all important course concepts from your textbook into those connections.

00:10:44.625 --> 00:10:47.850
You may even want to introduce outside research

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:51.915
into your own analysis to add energy to the learning community.

00:10:51.915 --> 00:10:53.850
For your writing assignment,

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:56.400
you'll be expected to create your own visual elements

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.295
using the six principles of graphic design.

00:10:59.295 --> 00:11:03.195
You may need to do a little research on your own for this assignment.

00:11:03.195 --> 00:11:08.610
In week 4, we learn to support messages with quality research and information,

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:12.840
as well as understand the use of visuals to further support our assertions.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:23.080
We also explore the dissemination of this valuable information [MUSIC].
